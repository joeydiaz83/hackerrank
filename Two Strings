Given two strings,a and b, determine if they share a common substring.

Input Format
The first line contains a single integer,p, denoting the number of (a,b) pairs you must check. 
Each pair is defined over two lines:

1.- The first line contains string a.
2.- The second line contains string b.

Constraints
a and b consist of lowercase English letters only.
1 <= p <= 10
1 <= |a|, |b| <= 10^5

Output Format
For each (a,b) pair of strings, print YES on a new line if the two strings share a common substring; if no such common substring exists, print NO on a new line.

Sample Input
2
hello
world
hi
world

Sample Output
YES
NO
Explanation

We have c=2 pairs to check:

1) a = "hello, b = "word". The substrings "o" and "l" are common to both a and b, so we print YES on a new line.
2) a = "hi, b = "world". Because a and b have no common substrings, we print NO on a new line.

Language: C++

#include <iostream>
#include <string>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int Cases;
    string S1, S2;
    cin >> Cases;
    while(Cases>0)
    {
        cin >> S1 >> S2;
        int found = S1.find_first_of(S2);
        string output = (found != string::npos)? "YES":"NO";
        cout << output << endl;
        --Cases;
    }
    return 0;
}
